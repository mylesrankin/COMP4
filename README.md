# COMP4
In my A-Level Computing coursework, I was given the task to find a user that had a problem and create a piece of software to suit their needs. I contacted the Photography Club, because I was aware that they had no centralised way of storing and managing photos online. After intensive research, interviews and planning I designed then created a photography management system much like popular sites Imgur & Flickr. I achieved this by utilising php & MySQL as a backend and then using my web development skills in HTML/CSS to create a user interface. I was the sole developer from start to finish, and documentation can be found above for reading in the file "Myles-Rankin_COMP4-Documentation.pdf"
